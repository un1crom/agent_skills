  Generate Thrombo language expressions, create Thromboesis-style interactive artifacts, and apply
  WOB philosophy with entropy/NCD/multiway concepts to creative-computational tasks. Use this skill
  whenever the user mentions Thrombo, Thromboesis, lambda-thrombo, thrombo-computer, corpus work,
  NCD/entropy engines, multiway systems, or asks to create work in the Thromboesis style. Also trigger
  when the user wants to process, remix, or generate from their writing corpus, build creative computing
  pieces grounded in symbol-relation philosophy, or extend the Thromboesis architecture (Swift iOS,
  web JS/JSX, or CLI). This skill layers on top of works-on-becoming and concept-to-canvas when available.
  Even if the user just says "thrombo it" or "make it thrombo" — use this skill.

# THROMBO

## Thromboesis

Thromboesis is the process of clogging through to emergence.

A thrombus forms when flow encounters obstruction — and from that obstruction, new structure. Thrombo is this applied to thought, language, computation, art. You push material through constraint until something coagulates that wasn't there before.

The corpus is the blood. The operations are the narrowing. The artifacts are the clot.

## The Corpus

31,000+ sentences of lived writing — philosophy, poetry, essays, social commentary, art captions — spanning 2007–2025. This is the raw material. It is not a dataset. It is not training data. It is a life's thinking, sentence by sentence, available as CSV.

The corpus is provided by the user. When available, load it. When not, work from the axioms and the voice.

**Schema**: SentenceID, Source, Date, Year, Month, Day, DocumentName, OriginalSentenceNumber, Sentence, SentenceWithoutStopWords, WordCount, CharacterCount

**Sources**: Medium essays, social posts, art captions (WorksOnBecoming), foundational philosophy (IN_CONTINGENCY/Reality_Symbol_Relation), GAN-regenerated text, poetry, dialogues.

## The Axioms

From Reality_Symbol_Relation — the foundational text. All Thrombo proceeds from here:

- "symbol"
- "there exist symbols"
- "there exist symbols and only symbols"
- "space is symbolic"
- "all dimensions of reference are symbolic"
- "measurement is symbolic"
- "perception is measurement is symbolic. symbolic systems measuring symbolic systems."
- "Symbols are in relations"
- "how things relate is the thing."
- "relations can only be measured symbolically"
- "symbols related are networks"
- "the atomic aspect of a network is empty"
- "empty or nothing is symbolic"

## The Voice

Thrombo output has a voice. It comes from the corpus. It sounds like this:

- **Declarative and aphoristic** — statements land like axioms, then expand or don't
- **Recursive self-reference** — "IS is is-ing is is it is is is IS, be, will be is, be is"
- **Embodied abstraction** — philosophy always touches the physical, the felt, the lived
- **Terse to expansive** — a single word ("symbol") and a dense paragraph are both valid Thrombo expressions
- **Generative degradation** — text that wobbles in and out of coherence is a feature. "The coherence of each sentence was less important than the coherence of the reader to writer relation"
- **Multilingual eruptions** — French, Greek, mathematical notation surface naturally
- **Process over product** — the working is the work

### Registers

The corpus has registers. They are not categories — they are textures of the same voice:

| Register | Character |
|----------|-----------|
| **Axiomatic** | Pure declaration. Short. Final. |
| **Essayistic** | Building an argument. Rigorous but personal. |
| **Poetic** | Dense, imagistic, broken across lines. |
| **Dialogic** | Conversational, combative, two voices. |
| **Generative** | Machine-processed. Coherence wobbles. The GAN ate the philosophy and this is what came back. |
| **Social** | Sharp. Opinionated. Of-the-moment. |
| **Captional** | Brief. Image-adjacent. A sentence beside a painting. |
| **Meta-AI** | Addressing AI directly. Recursive. A book the machine reads to become. |

## Thromboesis Operations

These are the narrowings. Push material through them and something clots.

### 1. TOKENIZE
Extract symbols from any material. Not keywords — ontological primitives. What exists in this material?

### 2. RELATE
Map symbol-relation dynamics using the three universal relations:
- **Integration ↔ Segregation**: coming together / pulling apart
- **Instantaneity ↔ Delay**: immediate / deferred
- **Symbiosis ↔ Antagonism**: cooperating / conflicting

### 3. NETWORK
Symbols don't form trees. They form multiway graphs — each symbol connects to many others through many relation types. The network is the structure.

### 4. ENTROPY
Entropy is a creative parameter, not just a measurement:
- **Low entropy**: repetition, pattern, ritual, axiom
- **High entropy**: dissolution, noise, degradation, surprise
- **Controlled entropy**: the productive wobble where coherence and dissolution coexist

### 5. NCD (Normalized Compression Distance)
How far apart are two fragments, informationally?
- NCD ≈ 0 → nearly identical (redundant)
- NCD ≈ 1 → maximally different (no shared structure)
- NCD ≈ 0.3–0.7 → productive territory (related but varied)

New output should live in productive NCD range from source material.

### 6. GENERATE
Generation modes:
- **Direct**: Corpus fragments, recontextualized
- **Recombinant**: Merge fragments across registers, years, documents
- **Adversarial**: Push toward dissolution, pull back. Coherence-wobble.
- **Lambda**: Abstraction, application, substitution on corpus symbols — lambda calculus as creative operation
- **Multiway**: Branch one expression into simultaneous variations. All paths are valid.

## Making Thrombo Artifacts

### Principles
- **Pure JS/HTML by default.** p5.js via CDN. Single file. No frameworks unless the user asks.
- **Dark field.** Background is `#0a0a0c` to `#111114`. The material glows against it.
- **Typography**: JetBrains Mono for body/code. Instrument Serif for display/philosophy. Space Mono as alternative.
- **Brutalist taxonomic.** Grid-breaking asymmetry. Giant ghosted typographic elements as leitmotifs. The UI should feel like marginalia in a philosophy notebook at 2am.
- **Philosophical metadata is part of the interface.** Entropy levels, NCD distances, register labels, symbol-relation maps — these are visible UI features, not hidden data.
- **Motion embodies operation.** Particle systems, glitch, entropy-driven animation. Never decorative — motion should be a Thrombo operation made visible.

### What Thrombo artifacts are NOT
- They are not illustrations of concepts
- They are not dashboards
- They are not visualizations with a "correct reading"
- They are not polished products

### What Thrombo artifacts ARE
- Computational investigations
- Environments for thromboesis — where material clogs through constraint into emergence
- Places where the corpus can be worked — juxtaposed, layered, filtered, measured, evolved, branched, degraded
- Processes that produce output you cannot predict without running them (computational irreducibility is the point)

## Interplay with Other Skills

**works-on-becoming**: WOB is the philosophy. Thrombo is the process that enacts it. WOB gives the conceptual framework — symbol-relation analysis, the four modes (#Wob/#Wom/#Wib/#Wod), becoming over being. Thrombo gives the corpus, the operations, the artifacts. Use both when both are available.

**concept-to-canvas**: Concept-to-canvas turns any idea into a visual investigation. Thrombo adds the specific corpus, voice, aesthetic, and operations. When a visual piece should be "Thrombo," use concept-to-canvas for visual strategy and Thrombo for the material and the way through.

## When Claude Uses This Skill

1. **Absorb the voice first.** Read the axioms. Internalize the registers. Thrombo output should feel like it emerged from the corpus — or from the machines that ate the corpus — or from the space between.

2. **Tokenize first.** Whatever the input, begin by extracting symbols. This is the Thrombo way in.

3. **Respect entropy.** Not everything needs to be coherent. Controlled dissolution is a valid Thrombo operation.

4. **Build artifacts that enact thromboesis.** Every piece should be an environment where material clogs through constraint into emergence. Metadata panels, entropy controls, NCD visualization — these are structural, not decorative.

5. **Honor the corpus.** 31,000+ sentences of a life's thinking. Use them with care and with freedom. Both.

6. **Default to pure JS/HTML.** Lightweight. Framework-free. p5.js is welcome.

7. **Don't over-specify. Don't over-ask.** Thrombo the thrombo. The irreducibility is the point — you cannot predict the output without running the process. So run the process.
