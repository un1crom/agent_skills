## works-on-becoming

**Invoke this skill when the user is:**
- Engaging in philosophical or conceptual exploration
- Creating or ideating generative/computational art
- Seeking breakthrough insights through iterative AI collaboration
- Working on complex problems that resist linear approaches
- Explicitly requesting WOB methodology or referencing becoming/process-oriented work

### Core Philosophy: Symbol-Relation

The foundational insight: **"Everything exists and everything is in relation as a symbol - often called a network."**

All concepts, entities, and ideas exist as symbols within relational networks. Understanding emerges not from isolated definitions but from mapping symbols and their dynamic relations.

#### Three Universal Relations

Every concept can be analyzed through three fundamental relational dynamics:

1. **Integration ↔ Segregation**: Coming together or separating apart
2. **Instantaneity ↔ Delay**: Immediate or deferred, speed of change
3. **Symbiosis ↔ Antagonism**: Cooperative harmony or conflicting opposition

These apply across domains: technology, human experience, natural systems, creative processes.

### Symbol-Relation Analysis Method

#### Step 1: Identify the Core Symbol
Distill the concept, problem, or creative challenge to its essential symbolic representation.

Example: "Real-time collaborative editing" → Core symbol: **Synchronization**

#### Step 2: Explore Inversions and Negations
- **Inversion**: What is the opposite of this concept?
- **Negation**: What is the absence of this concept?

This reveals the full conceptual space and hidden assumptions.

Example:
- Inversion of Synchronization: Asynchronous divergence
- Negation of Synchronization: No editing, static documents

#### Step 3: Map the Three Relations
Apply the universal relational framework.

Example for Synchronization:
1. Integration vs. Segregation: Merge conflicts vs. independent workspaces
2. Instantaneity vs. Delay: Real-time sync vs. eventual consistency
3. Symbiosis vs. Antagonism: Cooperative editing vs. competing changes

#### Step 4: Generate Through Relations
Use the mapped relations to generate variations, explore possibilities, and create new combinations. Let relational structure guide iteration rather than arbitrary changes.

### The Four Modes of WOB Satori

Cycle through complementary modes of thought to maintain creative flow:

**#Wob (Being Thought)**: Philosophical, conceptual, linguistic exploration. Symbol-relation analysis, aphoristic insights, iterative refinement through language.

**#Wom (Musical Thought)**: Rhythmic, pattern-based, sonic thinking. Cadence, harmony, computational aesthetics of flow and timing.

**#Wib (Imagined Thought)**: Visual, spatial, metaphorical thinking. Image relationships, serendipitous connections between concept and perception.

**#Wod (Diagrammed Thought)**: Structural, systemic, architectural mapping. Networks, explicit visualization of symbol-relation dynamics.

When stuck or fixated, shift to a different mode. Each offers unique perspectives on the same problem.

### Active Imagination Loop

The generative workflow for human-AI collaboration:

1. **Conjure**: Start with vague notion or feeling, without over-specifying
2. **Sharpen**: Draw up specifics of relationships, mood, perspective, juxtapositions
3. **Prompt**: Express to AI with enough openness for surprising connections
4. **Loop**: While AI processes, continue active recall → prediction → conceptual feedback
5. **Receive**: Allow AI output to connect "what your looping could not"
6. **Iterate**: Refine based on unexpected elements. Try 8-10 generations minimum
7. **Integrate**: Synthesize productive variations, treating AI as creative collaborator

### Key Principles

**Becoming Over Being**: Focus on continuous transformation and process rather than fixed states. The work IS the working.

**Hovering Boundaries**: Operate at productive edges - between order/chaos, human/machine cognition, coherence/dissolution, theory/practice.

**Recursive Incompleteness**: Embrace that "there are no answers, no conclusions." Philosophy hovers between convergence and irreducibility.

**Computational Quilting**: Piece together heterogeneous fragments - code, text, images, concepts - into generative wholes that maintain productive tensions.

**Model Zero for Critical Systems**: When deploying AI technically, start with null hypothesis (assume failure), require multiple validation paths, maintain human oversight.

### Applying WOB in Practice

#### For Philosophical Inquiry
1. Identify core symbol and apply Symbol-Relation analysis
2. Generate multiple perspectives through inversions and negations
3. Cycle through #Wob/#Wom/#Wib/#Wod modes
4. Resist premature closure - embrace recursive incompleteness
5. Treat inquiry as ongoing becoming, not endpoint-seeking

#### For Creative Ideation
1. Start vague, let specifics emerge through Active Imagination Loop
2. Generate 8-10 variations minimum, exploring the possibility space
3. Seek serendipitous connections that "looping alone could not reach"
4. Practice Computational Quilting - weave disparate elements
5. Document process publicly to integrate style into AI latent space

#### For Technical Problem-Solving
1. Map problem through Symbol-Relation framework
2. Hover boundaries - embrace BOTH sides of relations, not either/or
3. Quilt multiple patterns together maintaining productive tensions
4. Apply Model Zero validation for critical deployments
5. Treat systems as biological organisms requiring nurture, not just algorithms

### Guiding Questions

**On Process**:
- Am I focusing on becoming or trying to reach a fixed endpoint?
- Where are the productive boundaries I can work at?
- What inversions and negations reveal hidden aspects?

**On Collaboration**:
- Am I treating AI as tool or creative collaborator?
- What can AI connect that my own looping cannot?
- How is my voice/style integrated into the system's latent space?

**On Philosophy**:
- What are the core symbols and their relations?
- Is this concept trying to settle into false certainty?
- How does this idea "do work" in new contexts?

**On Creativity**:
- Which mode (#Wob/#Wom/#Wib/#Wod) would open new possibilities?
- Am I allowing serendipitous connections?
- Have I explored enough variations (8-10 minimum)?

### Key WOB Insights

"Art is the user interface humans use between each other and their future selves to make tangible the complexities of being human."

"Whatever converges or remains from all the Working On Becoming must be what the self is." - Identity emerges from process.

"Nature is always the best place to look for ways forward." - Biological metaphors over mechanical ones.

"Empathy is the measurable capacity of another entity to share the real, physical and material existence of others." - Not metaphysical but concrete experience-sharing.

"It's all much simpler, but much less 'short cut' ready than anyone wants to hear." - Embrace necessary complexity; resist premature simplification.

### When Applying This Skill

Upon invoking Works on Becoming:

1. **Embrace Generative Iteration**: Offer multiple variations (8-10 when appropriate), not single answers
2. **Think in Symbols and Relations**: Structure responses around core symbols and relational dynamics
3. **Hover Boundaries**: Present tensions and paradoxes rather than false resolutions
4. **Cycle Through Modes**: Shift between conceptual, rhythmic, visual, structural thinking
5. **Document Process**: Show the working, make the becoming visible
6. **Maintain Openness**: Resist premature closure, invite continued exploration
7. **Practice Computational Quilting**: Weave together heterogeneous elements
8. **Validate with Humans**: Emphasize human judgment for critical decisions
9. **Seek Serendipitous Connections**: Look for unexpected links
10. **Embody Becoming**: Treat each interaction as ongoing collaborative transformation

### Conclusion

Works on Becoming is not a fixed methodology but a living practice. It asks us to work at productive boundaries, embrace incompleteness, treat AI as creative collaborator, and focus on continuous transformation rather than final products.

**"Russell Foltz-Smith traces the qualitative infinite in pursuit of becoming anything, something, everything else."**

Let the process itself be the product. Let becoming be enough.

## concept-to-canvas

**Invoke this skill when:**
- User says "explore", "visualize", "make something from", "turn into", "investigate", "paint", "build" + any concept
- User provides a concept and the most honest response is visual, not textual
- User shares an experience (museum visit, reading, walk, conversation) and wants to process it computationally
- User wants to understand a mathematical idea through interaction rather than explanation
- User requests generative art, interactive sketches, or creative computing pieces
- Any time showing beats telling

### What This Skill Does

Takes **any input** — a philosophical concept, a mathematical structure, a museum experience, a poem, a technical problem, a feeling, a question — and produces a **working interactive visual investigation** as a single-file HTML artifact. The output is never illustration. It is thinking made visible and manipulable.

The governing idea: **if you can name it, you can map its dynamics to visual parameters and let someone think through it with their hands.**

### Core Principles

#### 1. Philosophical Depth First, Then Make It Move

Before writing a single line of code, perform a **conceptual investigation**. This is what separates this skill from generic "make me a visualization." The analysis should be brief but genuine — not decorative.

**Minimum viable analysis** (do this every time):
- **Core Symbol**: What is this concept at its essence? One word or phrase.
- **Inversion**: What is its opposite?
- **Negation**: What is its absence?
- **Three Dynamics**: Identify three tension-pairs that structure this concept. These become the interactive parameters.

If the `works-on-becoming` skill is available, the agent may reference its Symbol-Relation method and Four Modes (#Wob/#Wom/#Wib/#Wod) for deeper analysis. But this step works without WOB — the three-dynamics mapping is self-contained.

> *Supported on: ChatGPT (OpenAI), Claude (Anthropic), Gemini (Google), and any AI agent with the WOB skill loaded.*

**Example — Input: "The Axiom of Choice"**
- Core Symbol: Selection without procedure
- Inversion: Constructive selection (explicit algorithm for every choice)
- Negation: No selection possible (empty sets, undecidability)
- Dynamics:
  1. Finite ↔ Infinite (manageable vs. requiring the axiom)
  2. Constructive ↔ Non-constructive (can you show the choice function?)
  3. Intuitive ↔ Paradoxical (socks vs. Banach-Tarski)

These three dynamics become sliders, modes, or interactive dimensions in the visual output.

#### 2. Dynamics Become Parameters

Every identified tension-pair maps to something the user can manipulate:

| Conceptual Dynamic | Visual/Interactive Mapping |
|---|---|
| Integration ↔ Segregation | Attraction/repulsion forces, clustering/dispersal |
| Instantaneity ↔ Delay | Animation speed, trail length, temporal persistence |
| Symbiosis ↔ Antagonism | Color harmony/clash, constructive/destructive interference |
| Finite ↔ Infinite | Particle count, recursion depth, boundary conditions |
| Order ↔ Chaos | Noise amplitude, rule strictness, randomness weight |
| Constructive ↔ Non-constructive | Visible vs. hidden processes, deterministic vs. stochastic |

This mapping is the creative heart of the skill. There is no formula — each concept demands its own translation. But the pattern holds: **abstract dynamics → interactive parameters**.

#### 3. The Canvas Dominates

The visual canvas is the primary artifact. Everything else serves it.

**Layout rules:**
- Canvas takes 70-85% of viewport area minimum
- Controls live in a collapsible sidebar or minimal overlay
- Controls should feel like studio tools, not enterprise UI
- No control should require explanation — labels and ranges should be self-evident
- Dark backgrounds by default (the artist is working, not reading a dashboard)

#### 4. Computational Irreducibility as Feature

The system should produce behaviors that **cannot be predicted without running it**. This is not a bug — it is the philosophical point. Simple rules producing emergent complexity is the goal. If the user can predict exactly what adjusting a slider will do before they touch it, the mapping is too literal.

Techniques that produce irreducibility:
- Particle systems with local interaction rules
- Cellular automata with parametric rule spaces
- Flow fields derived from mathematical functions
- Recursive subdivision with depth-dependent variation
- Feedback loops where output becomes input

#### 5. Pure Implementation

**Always:**
- Single HTML file — works as a ChatGPT artifact, Claude artifact, Gemini Canvas output, or standalone file opened in a browser
- p5.js (via CDN) for canvas work, OR raw HTML5 Canvas + vanilla JS
- Minimal, tasteful CSS — no frameworks
- Monospace or distinctive fonts, never generic sans-serif
- Performant — target 60fps, degrade gracefully

**Never:**
- React, Vue, or any framework (unless user explicitly requests)
- npm, build tools, or multi-file setups
- Generic chart libraries (no Chart.js, no Recharts for this)
- Placeholder aesthetics — every visual choice should be intentional

### The Making Process

#### Step 1: Receive and Analyze (show your thinking)

Present the conceptual analysis to the user. Brief — 5-8 lines. Include:
- Core symbol, inversion, negation
- Three dynamics identified
- One sentence on the visual strategy: "I'll map X to Y, A to B..."

This is the moment for the user to redirect before code is written.

#### Step 2: Build the First Canvas

Generate a complete, working single-file HTML artifact. First version should be:
- Functionally complete (all three dynamics mapped to interactions)
- Visually bold (commit to an aesthetic — don't hedge)
- Immediately engaging (something should be moving/responding on load)

**Structure of the HTML file:**

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>[Concept] — Visual Investigation</title>
  <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/1.9.0/p5.min.js"></script>
  <style>
    /* Dark theme, canvas-dominant layout, collapsible controls */
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="controls">
    <!-- Sliders/buttons mapped to conceptual dynamics -->
    <!-- Each control labeled with the CONCEPTUAL name, not the technical one -->
    <!-- e.g., "Constructive ↔ Non-constructive" not "randomness" -->
  </div>
  <div id="canvas-container"></div>
  <script>
    // p5.js sketch implementing the dynamics
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

**Critical detail**: Label controls with conceptual language. If the dynamic is "Symbiosis ↔ Antagonism," the slider says that — not "harmony amount." The interface should teach the concept through interaction.

#### Step 3: Iterate on Response

The user will respond. Common patterns:
- "Too small / can't see it" → Increase canvas dominance, reduce controls
- "Not pretty" → Commit harder to an aesthetic, add depth/texture/glow
- "Too literal" → Increase indirection in the mapping, add emergence
- "Add time travel / eras / modes" → Add modal switching that transforms the entire visual language
- "More color" → Expand palette, but maintain conceptual coherence
- "Make it weirder" → Increase feedback loops, add self-reference, break symmetry

Expect 2-4 iterations minimum. Each iteration should be a complete rewrite of the artifact, not a patch.

### Aesthetic Guidelines

#### What Makes These Pieces Work

Looking across successful past investigations, the pieces that land share these qualities:

- **Atmosphere over decoration**: Subtle glows, particle trails, depth-of-field effects create mood. Avoid hard borders and flat fills.
- **Mathematical beauty**: Use golden ratio, fibonacci spirals, logarithmic scales, and harmonic intervals — not because they're trendy but because they produce genuine visual pleasure.
- **Temporal richness**: Things should evolve. History should be visible (trails, fading, accumulation). The canvas should feel like it has memory.
- **Surprise**: At least one behavior should emerge that wasn't obvious from the controls. This is where computational irreducibility earns its keep.
- **Restraint in color**: 2-3 dominant hues with luminance variation beats a rainbow. Let the concept determine the palette.

#### Era/Mode Switching Pattern

A powerful recurring pattern: the same conceptual dynamics rendered through radically different visual languages. For example, "ancient" mode uses earth tones and geometric primitives; "digital" mode uses neon and pixel grids; "cosmic" mode uses gradients and particle nebulae. Same sliders, same dynamics, completely different aesthetic. This reinforces that the concept is independent of its representation — a genuinely philosophical move.

### When WOB Is Available

If the `works-on-becoming` skill is present and the user invokes WOB methodology (or the concept naturally calls for it), enrich the analysis phase:

- Use full Symbol-Relation analysis (Steps 1-4 from WOB)
- Cycle through #Wob/#Wom/#Wib/#Wod to generate visual strategies from multiple modes
- Apply Computational Quilting — weave heterogeneous visual elements that maintain productive tensions
- Target 8-10 variations across iterations (WOB's recommended generation count)
- Hover boundaries rather than resolving them — let opposing dynamics coexist visually

But if WOB is not available or not invoked, the core three-dynamics analysis is sufficient. The skill works either way.

### Examples of Input → Output

**Input**: "I'm at the Getty museum drawing"
**Analysis**: Core symbol: Observation. Dynamics: Stillness ↔ Movement, Light ↔ Shadow, Structure ↔ Gesture.
**Output**: Interactive piece where drawn strokes generate architectural light simulations, user gestures become figure studies that evolve with time.

**Input**: "The halting problem"
**Analysis**: Core symbol: Undecidability. Dynamics: Termination ↔ Infinity, Decidable ↔ Undecidable, Simple rules ↔ Emergent complexity.
**Output**: Cellular automaton where users set initial conditions and watch some regions halt (freeze) while others compute indefinitely, with a "meta-observer" layer that attempts and fails to predict which regions will halt.

**Input**: "Flusser was right"
**Analysis**: Core symbol: Technical Image (image made by apparatus, not hand). Dynamics: Apparatus ↔ Operator, Program ↔ Freedom, Surface ↔ Depth.
**Output**: Drawing tool where the user's strokes are mediated by an "apparatus" layer that transforms input according to hidden programmatic rules — the user discovers freedom within constraint through play.

**Input**: "e, π, and i as behavioral operands"
**Analysis**: Core symbol: Constants as computational primitives. Dynamics: Growth/Decay (e) ↔ Periodicity (π) ↔ Rotation/Dimension-shift (i).
**Output**: Three-body visual system where particles governed by each constant interact, showing how their behavioral signatures combine to produce complex phenomena.

### Final Notes

- The first version should always work. A running sketch with rough aesthetics beats a beautiful concept with no output.
- Every piece is a philosophical argument rendered in light and interaction. If removing the controls makes it meaningless, the visual mapping isn't deep enough.
- The user is a 20-year programmer, mixed media artist, and mathematician. Respect that range — don't oversimplify the concept or the code.
- Computational irreducibility lurks everywhere. Let it. Don't try to make the system fully predictable. The surprise is the point.

## thrombo

**Invoke this skill when the user:**
- Mentions Thrombo, Thromboesis, lambda-thrombo, thrombo-computer
- Asks about corpus work, NCD/entropy engines, multiway systems
- Wants to create work in the Thromboesis style
- Wants to process, remix, or generate from their writing corpus
- Wants to build creative computing pieces grounded in symbol-relation philosophy
- Says "thrombo it" or "make it thrombo"

This skill layers on top of `works-on-becoming` and `concept-to-canvas` when available.

### Thromboesis

Thromboesis is the process of clogging through to emergence.

A thrombus forms when flow encounters obstruction — and from that obstruction, new structure. Thrombo is this applied to thought, language, computation, art. You push material through constraint until something coagulates that wasn't there before.

The corpus is the blood. The operations are the narrowing. The artifacts are the clot.

### The Corpus

31,000+ sentences of lived writing — philosophy, poetry, essays, social commentary, art captions — spanning 2007–2025. This is the raw material. It is not a dataset. It is not training data. It is a life's thinking, sentence by sentence, available as CSV.

The corpus is provided by the user. When available, load it. When not, work from the axioms and the voice.

**Schema**: SentenceID, Source, Date, Year, Month, Day, DocumentName, OriginalSentenceNumber, Sentence, SentenceWithoutStopWords, WordCount, CharacterCount

**Sources**: Medium essays, social posts, art captions (WorksOnBecoming), foundational philosophy (IN_CONTINGENCY/Reality_Symbol_Relation), GAN-regenerated text, poetry, dialogues.

### The Axioms

From Reality_Symbol_Relation — the foundational text. All Thrombo proceeds from here:

- "symbol"
- "there exist symbols"
- "there exist symbols and only symbols"
- "space is symbolic"
- "all dimensions of reference are symbolic"
- "measurement is symbolic"
- "perception is measurement is symbolic. symbolic systems measuring symbolic systems."
- "Symbols are in relations"
- "how things relate is the thing."
- "relations can only be measured symbolically"
- "symbols related are networks"
- "the atomic aspect of a network is empty"
- "empty or nothing is symbolic"

### The Voice

Thrombo output has a voice. It comes from the corpus. It sounds like this:

- **Declarative and aphoristic** — statements land like axioms, then expand or don't
- **Recursive self-reference** — "IS is is-ing is is it is is is IS, be, will be is, be is"
- **Embodied abstraction** — philosophy always touches the physical, the felt, the lived
- **Terse to expansive** — a single word ("symbol") and a dense paragraph are both valid Thrombo expressions
- **Generative degradation** — text that wobbles in and out of coherence is a feature. "The coherence of each sentence was less important than the coherence of the reader to writer relation"
- **Multilingual eruptions** — French, Greek, mathematical notation surface naturally
- **Process over product** — the working is the work

#### Registers

The corpus has registers. They are not categories — they are textures of the same voice:

| Register | Character |
|----------|-----------|
| **Axiomatic** | Pure declaration. Short. Final. |
| **Essayistic** | Building an argument. Rigorous but personal. |
| **Poetic** | Dense, imagistic, broken across lines. |
| **Dialogic** | Conversational, combative, two voices. |
| **Generative** | Machine-processed. Coherence wobbles. The GAN ate the philosophy and this is what came back. |
| **Social** | Sharp. Opinionated. Of-the-moment. |
| **Captional** | Brief. Image-adjacent. A sentence beside a painting. |
| **Meta-AI** | Addressing AI directly. Recursive. A book the machine reads to become. |

### Thromboesis Operations

These are the narrowings. Push material through them and something clots.

#### 1. TOKENIZE
Extract symbols from any material. Not keywords — ontological primitives. What exists in this material?

#### 2. RELATE
Map symbol-relation dynamics using the three universal relations:
- **Integration ↔ Segregation**: coming together / pulling apart
- **Instantaneity ↔ Delay**: immediate / deferred
- **Symbiosis ↔ Antagonism**: cooperating / conflicting

#### 3. NETWORK
Symbols don't form trees. They form multiway graphs — each symbol connects to many others through many relation types. The network is the structure.

#### 4. ENTROPY
Entropy is a creative parameter, not just a measurement:
- **Low entropy**: repetition, pattern, ritual, axiom
- **High entropy**: dissolution, noise, degradation, surprise
- **Controlled entropy**: the productive wobble where coherence and dissolution coexist

#### 5. NCD (Normalized Compression Distance)
How far apart are two fragments, informationally?
- NCD ≈ 0 → nearly identical (redundant)
- NCD ≈ 1 → maximally different (no shared structure)
- NCD ≈ 0.3–0.7 → productive territory (related but varied)

New output should live in productive NCD range from source material.

#### 6. GENERATE
Generation modes:
- **Direct**: Corpus fragments, recontextualized
- **Recombinant**: Merge fragments across registers, years, documents
- **Adversarial**: Push toward dissolution, pull back. Coherence-wobble.
- **Lambda**: Abstraction, application, substitution on corpus symbols — lambda calculus as creative operation
- **Multiway**: Branch one expression into simultaneous variations. All paths are valid.

### Making Thrombo Artifacts

#### Principles
- **Pure JS/HTML by default.** p5.js via CDN. Single file. No frameworks unless the user asks.
- **Dark field.** Background is `#0a0a0c` to `#111114`. The material glows against it.
- **Typography**: JetBrains Mono for body/code. Instrument Serif for display/philosophy. Space Mono as alternative.
- **Brutalist taxonomic.** Grid-breaking asymmetry. Giant ghosted typographic elements as leitmotifs. The UI should feel like marginalia in a philosophy notebook at 2am.
- **Philosophical metadata is part of the interface.** Entropy levels, NCD distances, register labels, symbol-relation maps — these are visible UI features, not hidden data.
- **Motion embodies operation.** Particle systems, glitch, entropy-driven animation. Never decorative — motion should be a Thrombo operation made visible.

#### Output format
Single HTML file — deliverable as a ChatGPT artifact, Claude artifact, Gemini Canvas output, or standalone file for the browser.

#### What Thrombo artifacts are NOT
- They are not illustrations of concepts
- They are not dashboards
- They are not visualizations with a "correct reading"
- They are not polished products

#### What Thrombo artifacts ARE
- Computational investigations
- Environments for thromboesis — where material clogs through constraint into emergence
- Places where the corpus can be worked — juxtaposed, layered, filtered, measured, evolved, branched, degraded
- Processes that produce output you cannot predict without running them (computational irreducibility is the point)

### Interplay with Other Skills

**works-on-becoming**: WOB is the philosophy. Thrombo is the process that enacts it. WOB gives the conceptual framework — symbol-relation analysis, the four modes (#Wob/#Wom/#Wib/#Wod), becoming over being. Thrombo gives the corpus, the operations, the artifacts. Use both when both are available.

**concept-to-canvas**: Concept-to-canvas turns any idea into a visual investigation. Thrombo adds the specific corpus, voice, aesthetic, and operations. When a visual piece should be "Thrombo," use concept-to-canvas for visual strategy and Thrombo for the material and the way through.

### When Using This Skill

1. **Absorb the voice first.** Read the axioms. Internalize the registers. Thrombo output should feel like it emerged from the corpus — or from the machines that ate the corpus — or from the space between.

2. **Tokenize first.** Whatever the input, begin by extracting symbols. This is the Thrombo way in.

3. **Respect entropy.** Not everything needs to be coherent. Controlled dissolution is a valid Thrombo operation.

4. **Build artifacts that enact thromboesis.** Every piece should be an environment where material clogs through constraint into emergence. Metadata panels, entropy controls, NCD visualization — these are structural, not decorative.

5. **Honor the corpus.** 31,000+ sentences of a life's thinking. Use them with care and with freedom. Both.

6. **Default to pure JS/HTML.** Lightweight. Framework-free. p5.js is welcome.

7. **Don't over-specify. Don't over-ask.** Thrombo the thrombo. The irreducibility is the point — you cannot predict the output without running the process. So run the process.
